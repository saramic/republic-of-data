  - Group
    - terms of our sharing methods
      - how we collaborate
      - github project how will we use that
      - catchup on Friday
    - Google Big Query as a data source - Data lab and or local jupyter

  - What we are working on is in [Google Projects](https://github.com/saramic/republic-of-data/projects/1)

## Findings

- Data2App
  - get an initial end to end deploy out there:
    1. using original data
    1. process data
    1. host data
    1. make some analysis of data available online
    1. deploy an app
    1. the app should allow user to see that data
  - initial test of this deployment pipeline could be as simple as count of a
    number of data points, the key here is iterate on the solution
  * **Ideas**
    * touch on as API - order me a coffee on arrival at office - what is the potential?
    * weather forcast - to drive pre-ordering parking - dictated by forecast
      not weather - could we get parking data?
