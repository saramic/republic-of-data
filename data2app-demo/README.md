# Data2App - demo

local demo for playing around with. Actual Data2App will be built
in a seperate repo.

## Run

```
yarn
yarn start
open localhost:3000
```

## TODO
- Data2App
  - get an initial end to end deploy out there:
    1. using original data
    1. process data
    1. host data
    1. make some analysis of data available online
    1. deploy an app
    1. the app should allow user to see that data
  - initial test of this deployment pipeline could be as simple as count of a
    number of data points, the key here is iterate on the solution

## Done

```
npm install -g create-react-app
create-react-app data2app-demo
```

## Ideas
  * touch on as API - order me a coffee on arrival at office - what is the potential?
  * weather forcast - to drive pre-ordering parking - dictated by forecast
    not weather - could we get parking data?
  * how many people loose money touching on in free tram zone
