# Scripts

## Denormalize car speed vehichle traffic data

assumint ruby is installed, to run

```
bundle
./denormalize_car_speed_vehicle_traffic.rb
```

this will hopefully create a 64Mb file

```
../MelbDatathon2018/car_speeds/melbourne_vehicle_traffic_normalized_generted.csv
```

Now you can import this into QGIS and classify the fields

It may be an idea to normalize the values and do something with -1 values?
