# Data2App

## Ideas
  * touch on as API - order me a coffee on arrival at office - what is the potential?
  * weather forcast - to drive pre-ordering parking - dictated by forecast not weather - could we get parking data?
  * weather forecast for predicted destination
  * auto recharge app based on my usage patterns
  * personalised disruption alerts based on lines I often use

## Notes from app tutorial

- To create a data-driven app, we tend to set up a pipeline:

      Data > Clean > Feature Extraction > Modelling > Insights > App

- Customers want to interact with their own data (cf. Powershop)
- Visualisation linked to action: making the data do something real

### Instructions

1. Build an app
2. Make a YouTube video to demo the app (3 minutes)
3. Host it on the web

### Things to keep in mind

- Does the app tell a good story with insights?
- Does the app facilitate business actions based on those insights?
- Does the application effectively make use of current technology?
- Is the application scalable to a real-world production environment?
